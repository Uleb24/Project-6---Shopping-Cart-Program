# Project-6---Shopping-Cart-Program
I created a mini-shop by myself.

This is by far the biggest project I worked on.

This came from the youtube video I am watching to learn the basics of Python (I am at around 3h/12h total).

At the start the youtuber showed an extremely simple and basic version of the shopping cart program.

I decided I wanted to make it better and more complex, so I changed his project myself and made it into a mini-shop.

All the problems and issues I ran into were fixed by myself, with the only help being my notes I write while learning from his 12h video.

I am going to continue on making even bigger and more complex projects obviously, but this is a huge milestone in my journey, and I am especially happy how I tackled the issues I ran into whilst coding this.

Thank you for reading !
